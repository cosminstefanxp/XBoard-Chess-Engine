Project details:
	- developed in a team of 4 people for a university project
		-Stefan-Dobrin Cosmin
		-Nita Catalina
		-Rizea Daniel-Octavian
		-Voiculescu Rafaela
	- developed in C/C++
	- uses XBoard for graphical interface
	
Algorithm & implementation details:
	- the engine has a lot of optimizations, for example: bitboards for efficient storage of board details
	- uses NegaMax algorithm
	- Iterative Deepening
	- uses Alpha-Beta Prunning
	- uses Quesence Search
	- has NegaScout implemented, but not used due to some small bugs that still had to be solved
	- has an advanced evaluation function
	- uses a moves book for the starting moves
